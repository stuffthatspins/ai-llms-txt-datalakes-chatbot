## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Plugin for Wordpress

# ai-llms-txt-datalakes-chatbot
This is a Wordpress plugin to create JSON Datalakes and llms.txt files for GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). 

# JSON Datalakes
I proposed making datalakes for your site so that LLMs don't have to crawl through a ton of garbage to get to the content. This plugin will create a JSON datalake file and a JSONL datalike file for training your machine learning AI bots.

# llms.txt
llms.txt files aims to do the same thing I propose with website datalakes. This is in standard markdown loanguage and has a llms.txt and llms-full.txt proposed format.
